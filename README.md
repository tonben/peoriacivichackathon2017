## The Challenge Statement

**Create a product that will assist residents, business owners, and visitors of our region in getting information on the extent of our current and planned infrastructure projects.**

## Background

Infrastructure investments are some of the most expensive projects that the City embarks on. To most Peorians, these projects often become construction areas to avoid. Residents, businesses, and commuters seek information on these projects, but sometimes the City's communications don't reach them. A homeowner may want to know how long he will see a bulldozer on his street, a business owner may want to know how long the sidewalk next to her business will take to be paved, and someone driving into Peoria will want to know how long they will need to take an alternative route to get to their job downtown.

Infrastructure projects make traveling by car, bus, bike or other mode of transporation easier in the long run, but can pose a challenge to users during the construction phase. How can the City of Peoria better inform people in our region of the extent and status of our infrastructure projects? The City is releasing a data set containing information on all of our largest infrastructure projects. Today's challenge is to use this data to create a solution that communicates this information in an engaging way to the persons that will most likely be interested and affected by it.

It may be helpful to consider:  
+ *How could residents become better informed of infrastructure projects that are near their homes?*  
+ *How could business owners become better informed of infrastructure projects that may affect their commercial space or the clients that come to their space?*  
+ *How could visitors to Peoria become better informed of infrastructure projects that they might encounter during their commute or trips into town?*  
+ *How could people receive information on various digital devices?*

## Context

### Who leads our infrastructure projects?

The City's Public Works Department has a staff of engineers that act as project managers who watch over the projects from design through construction.  They manage a team of consultants through the design phase, and once that is complete they follow the project through the construction phase. 

### Who is affected by infrastructure projects?

Infrastructure projects can impact some unlikely suspects. You may immediately think about the time your car trip took longer than anticipated, but have you ever thought about a child walking to school, a bus route that has to move, a bike path that is no longer accessible, or a business owner who struggles to get customers to his or her location due to construction? From residents to visitors and everyone in between, we are all impacted by the inconvenient but necessary work of infrastructure updates. 

### Glossary of Terms

**Arterial Streets** -  high volume roadways that connect major urban centers or freeways.  
**City Council District** - City Council, which comprises 10 Council Members plus the Mayor, is the representative body of the City of Peoria. 5 of the 11 officials are elected from each of the 5 districts that the City is divided into.  
**Graphic Information System** - a system designed to capture, store, manipulate, analyze, manage, and present spatial or geographic data. The City of Peoria Public Works Department uses GIS programs to internally visualize geospatial data. References to GIS may be seen throughout the City's data sets.   
**Pavement Condition Index** - (PCI) is used to indicate the general condition of the roadway in which a score of 0 represents the worst condition, and 100 would be the best condition.  PCI scores above 70 are eligible for pavement preservation treatments.  Once a street gets below that, there are more factors that have to be considered.  There comes a point that the City would not use any pavement preservation treatments on the roadway if the PCI is too low.  Those roadways would require a reconstruction of the pavement.  
**Sidewalk Construction Type** - Sidewalks typically fall into one of two categories.  Curb side sidewalk is sidewalk that is directly against the curb.  Buffered sidewalk will have a green space between the sidewalk and the curb.  

## Judging Criteria
